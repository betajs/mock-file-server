BetaJS Mock File Server for Testing



## Getting Started


This a mock file server for testing uploading and retrieving files.

Files are stored in the memory of the server for a short time and are then removed.

```shell
npm install mock-file-server
```

You can then run the server as follows:

```shell
node node_modules/mock-file-server/server.js
```

You can also run it as a `grunt task`.



## Basic Usage


The server creates the following endpoints:

- GET /files/:filename/size`: returns the size of an uploaded file as json `{"size": size}`
- GET `/files/:filename`: returns an uploaded file as binary stream
- POST `/files/:filename`: stores an uploaded single file with field name `file`
- POST `/chunk/:filename`: stores a single chunk with field name `file` with the chunk number being present in the request body
- POST `/assemble/:filename`: assembles a chunked file, checking the total size with the total size being present in the request body
- OPTIONS : for CORS support, allowing every site to access files
